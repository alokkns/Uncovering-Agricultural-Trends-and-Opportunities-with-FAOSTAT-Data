An executive summary:
  - What is your goal?
The goal of this analysis is to identify trends and opportunities within the agricultural sector across various countries and crops using the FAOSTAT dataset. 
By analysing key agricultural metrics such as area harvested, yield, and production volumes, we aim to uncover potential markets for agribusiness expansion. 
This analysis seeks to guide strategic decisions for international expansion by pinpointing regions with favourable agricultural trends and robust production capabilities.

Where did you get your data?
The primary data source for this analysis is the FAOSTAT dataset, which includes comprehensive agricultural data on various crops and livestock products from numerous countries.

What are your metrics?
Area harvested
Yield
Production volumes

What were your findings?
Significant growth trends in agricultural production and yields were identified across various countries and products.
Certain crops showed consistent improvement in yield and production, highlighting regions with expanding agricultural productivity.
Potential markets for agribusiness expansion were identified based on these trends.

What risks/limitations/assumptions affect these findings?
Data Limitations: The FAOSTAT dataset may have gaps or inconsistencies in certain regions or time periods.
Political, economic, and environmental factors affecting agriculture in different countries were not accounted for.
It is assumed that the trends observed will continue into the future, though this may not always hold true.

Summarize your statistical analysis, including:
  - Implementation
Data Acquisition: The FAOSTAT dataset was imported and pre-processed for analysis.
Data Transformation: Key metrics (area harvested, yield, and production volumes) were extracted and cleaned for analysis.
Statistical Methods: Descriptive statistics and trend analysis were performed to identify significant patterns and opportunities.

Results and Findings from models-
Linear Regression Models
Baseline Model:
Mean Absolute Error: 3.394417681078034e-09
Mean Squared Error: 1.0107790084728872e-16
R-squared: 1.0
Linear Regression with hyperparameter tuning

Tuned Model Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error: 3.394417681078034e-09
Mean Squared Error: 1.0107790084728872e-16
R-squared: 1.0
Insight: Both the baseline linear regression model and the hyperparameter-tuned model perform exceptionally well with an R-squared of 1.0, indicating a perfect fit.
This is highly unusual and suggests that the data might be extremely linear.

Ridge Regression model (with hyperparameter tuning)
Ridge Regression MSE: 365.43432534456224
Insight: The Ridge Regression model significantly deviates from the perfect scores of the linear models. While it regularizes the coefficients to prevent overfitting, its performance suggests that the 
linear model was already optimal, and that Ridge regression might not be the best choice for this dataset.

Lasso Regression model (with hyperparameter tuning)
Lasso Regression MSE: 8141336.52291233
Insight: The Lasso Regression model performs much worse than Ridge Regression. This indicates that the features in the dataset might not be sparse, or that Lassoâ€™s ability to set some coefficients to zero is not beneficial for this problem.

Random Forest Regression model (with hyperparameter tuning)
Random Forest Regression MSE: 36166277273.16929
Insight: The Random Forest model has a very high MSE, indicating poor performance compared to linear models. This might suggest that the data has a strong linear relationship that tree-based models fail to capture effectively.

Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
Gradient Boosting Regression MSE: 57660245667.82349
Insight: Gradient Boosting also shows high MSE, further indicating that boosting methods might not be suitable for this dataset if the underlying relationships are largely linear.

AdaBoost Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
AdaBoost Regression MSE: 1096522517664.4102
Insight: AdaBoost has an even higher MSE than Gradient Boosting and Random Forest, suggesting that boosting weak learners is not effective for this particular problem.

Decision Tree Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
Decision Tree Regression MSE: 58915043854.47922
Insight: The Decision Tree model also shows a very high MSE, indicating overfitting or that it fails to capture the linear relationships in the data.

Linear Relationships:
The linear regression models (both baseline and tuned) have near-perfect performance, suggesting the data has a very strong linear relationship. This also hints that the dataset may be small or overly simplistic.
Regularization:
The Ridge regression, though not as perfect as the linear regression, still performs better than Lasso, suggesting that regularization might be necessary but the data does not benefit from sparsity.
Non-Linear Models:
Tree-based and boosting models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Decision Trees) perform significantly worse, indicating that non-linear relationships or complex interactions are not prominent in the data.

Model Selection:
For this dataset, simpler models like Linear Regression (with or without regularization) are much more effective than complex ensemble methods.
